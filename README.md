# Ladies and gents, welcome!

This is my repo for the project I did @ Trybe.
The project intended to solidify our knowledge about docker and docker compose.
<br>
The parts made by ***myself*** are the following: <br>
* command01.dc up to command12.dc, inside ./docker/docker-commands
* The 3 Dockerfiles, inside ./docker/todo-app/[back-end | front-end | tests]
* The docker-compose.yml file, inside ./docker
<br>
Everything else was already done, because the point of this project was not to build a full-stack app. We'll learn that later.

<br>
If you want to get in touch, to ask about something project-specific, or to say 'hi!', feel free to visit my profile, which has a link to my LinkedIn.

If you read this far, thank you! Be sure to come back!
